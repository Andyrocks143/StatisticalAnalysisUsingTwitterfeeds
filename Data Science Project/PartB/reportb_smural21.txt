----Determining the sentiment of each tweet----
This was completed on 23rd March at 10 AM in the morning.

The command should be ran as indicated in the Assignment question:
	$python3 tweet_sentiment_smural21.py <sentiment_file> <tweet_file> > tweet_sentiment_smural21.txt

The sentiment file is assumed to be in the data folder.
The tweet file is assumed to be in the same folder as the python script - tweet_sentiment_smural21.py

The top 10 and bottom 10 tweets:

Algorithm:

1. Store the sentiment scores for words from the given sentiment file.
2. Then, store each tweet as a key in a dictionary.
3. Then parse through each tweet.
4. Pick each word from the tweet.
5. Check if it the entire string is an alphabetic string.
6. If not, try removing the extra characters like (",'!#().) and test for the remaining word.
7. Then add scores from each word to the total tweet score.
8. Add the corresponding tweet score to the tweet's score in the dictionary.
9. After compiling the score for every tweet, sort a list based on the score.
10. Then print according to the expected output -> (score: tweet).

Other notes/Considerations:
1. I have added a few more words to the sentiment words in the file AFINN111.txt like smileys.
2. I also trimmed down words like Love!!! -> Love, Wow!!!! - Wow, Bad. -> Bad. This helped in including the score for these words which werent detected because of the special characters or punctuations.

7. Then add scores from each word to the total tweet score.
8. Add the corresponding tweet score to the actor's score.
9. Compute the average sentiment score by using the formula - (TotalScore/Total number of tweets by the actor).
10. After compiling the score for every actor, sort a list based on the score.
11. Then print according to the expected output -> (score: username).

----Happiest States----

Top 5 happiest states:

2.0000 :  DE
1.7857 :  MO
1.6071 :  IL
1.5000 :  VT
1.3333 :  MI

Top 5 unhappiest states:

-4.0000 :  AK
-3.6667 :  UT
-1.8333 :  MS
-0.8571 :  HI
-0.8000 :  NM

Abbreviations:
DE- Delaware
MO- Missouri
IL- Illinois
VT- Vermont
MI- Michigan
AK- Arkansas
UT- Utah
MS- Mississippi
HI- Hawaii
NM- New Mexico

Algorithm Used:

1. Collect all states data as abbreviations and full names into a dictionary.
2. Collect all word sentiment score into a dictionary.
3. Parse each tweet text and compute the score for that particular tweet.
4. Immediately, find the related states to each tweet.
5. For finding related state, parse through the location and place attribute.
6. In location attribute, find words of the format - (city, State) or (State, USA) or (StateAbbreviation, USA) or (City,State,USA).
7. In the place attribute, split up the words and search for states or state abbreviations. Eg: I love Illinois.
8. Then evaluate the found state with the dictionary and that state to the related state list for that tweet.
9. For each state in the related state list, assign the tweet score to it and increase the tweet count for that state as well.
10. Compute the average sentiment score by using the formula - (TotalScore/Total number of tweets related to the state).
11. Sort the list according to average score.
12. Print acording to the expected output : <State score: State abbreviation>.


Considerations/Other notes:

I. General notes:
	1. All input tweet files are of the streaming_output_full.txt format.
	2. No external geocoder service is used.
	3. US state list with abbreviations was self compiled and put into a csv file in the data folder named : "USAstates.csv".

II. Data cleaning and parsing:
	1. The data fetched was done so in the json format.
	2. While checking each word in the tweet for states, all trailing and leading symbols were removed to make sure data isnt 	lost. Eg: #Miami -> Miami, Landed in Texas!!!! -> Landed in Texas
	3. All the format checking was done after making sure there were a majority of them when compared to the dirty data.
	4. Words without symbols were trimmed to make sure sentiment scores were not missed. Eg: Wow!!!! -> Wow, I am good. -> I am good 


III. Other notes:
	1. The final score is printed upto 4 decimal places after careful observation of the data to make sure efficient comparisons could be made.
	2. A pre analysis of the data showed that there was a higher probability of finding a state in the 'user location' attribute than the 'place' attribute.
	3. Out of a sample tweet count of 5405 tweets, the tweets from USA was around 3409. Among this 3409, the 'user location' attribute had a hit of 1093 state matches. The 'place' attribute accounted for 495 state matches. So the total analysis was made on 2588 tweets. To note: This was for the sample file I created -> streaming_output_full_smural21.txt.It can vary for other files.
